# 🌟 Introduction

The **AI-Based Dental Radiograph Analysis System** is a computer vision and machine learning project designed to analyze **panoramic dental X-ray images (OPG)** and assist dentists in identifying dental conditions automatically.

Dental radiographs are an essential diagnostic tool used in dentistry to detect cavities, implants, impacted teeth, bone loss, and other abnormalities. However, analyzing these radiographs manually can be time-consuming and requires trained professionals.

This project explores the use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision, and Machine Learning** to automate dental radiograph analysis. The system processes dental X-ray images, segments tooth regions, extracts visual features, and predicts dental conditions using a trained machine learning model.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **AI-assisted systems can support dentists in faster and more accurate diagnostic decision-making**, paving the way for future smart dental healthcare systems.

# ⚙️ Methodology

The system follows a multi-step methodology:

### 1. Image Acquisition

Dental radiograph images are provided as input to the system.

### 2. Image Preprocessing

The images are processed to enhance quality and remove noise using:

* grayscale conversion
* filtering
* contrast adjustment

### 3. Tooth Segmentation

Image segmentation techniques are used to isolate teeth from the surrounding structures.

This is achieved using:

* thresholding
* contour detection
* region extraction

### 4. Feature Extraction

After segmentation, important features are extracted such as:

* contour area
* intensity distribution
* texture patterns
* edge features

These features help the model identify different dental conditions.

### 5. Machine Learning Classification

A machine learning model is trained on labeled features to classify dental conditions.

### 6. Visualization

Detected regions and predicted labels are displayed on the dental X-ray image for interpretation.

# 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains dental radiograph images used for training and testing the machine learning model.

Expected dataset structure:

```

      │     ├── Implant
      │     └── Normal
      │
      ├── valid

      │     ├── Implant
      │     └── Normal
      │
      └── test
            ├── Cavity

            ├── Impacted Tooth
            ├── Implant
            └── Normal
```

The **_annotations.csv** file contains labels for the images that are used during training.

Typical labels may include dental conditions such as:

* Normal tooth
* Cavity
* Filling
* Implant
* Impacted tooth

A larger dataset improves the model’s accuracy and generalization.
